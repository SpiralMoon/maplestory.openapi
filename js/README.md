## Notice

>🌏 Notice 1: Starting from version 3.4.0, support for tms region has been added. You can now retrieve data from [KMS](https://maplestory.nexon.com/), [TMS](https://maplestory.beanfun.com/), [MSEA](http://www.maplesea.com/index/).
>
>🌏 Notice 2: Starting from version 3.0.0, support for msea region has been added.
>
>💡 Notice 3: Migration is required when updating from version 2.x.x to 3.0.0. Please refer to the documentation for [Migration](https://github.com/SpiralMoon/maplestory.openapi/tree/master/js/docs/migration-en.md).

## Installation

Install the latest version of the JavaScript/TypeScript library in your npm project:

```bash
npm install maplestory-openapi
```

## Usage

### API Key

Before using the library, register your application and obtain an **api key** from the [Nexon Open API Console](https://openapi.nexon.com/my-application/).

Applications must be registered separately for each region. (For example, an API key issued for KMS cannot be used to request data from MSEA.)

### Region

Currently, this library supports data retrieval from the KMS, TMS, MSEA regions. To access data from a specific region, import the corresponding package path.

```typescript
import { MapleStoryApi } from 'maplestory-openapi/kms'; // data from KMS
// or
import { MapleStoryApi } from 'maplestory-openapi/msea'; // data from MSEA
```

Even though the regions differ, each package inherits the same interface, ensuring a consistent API usage experience across all regions.

### Supports

1. **TypeScript Support**: TypeScript is fully supported. Type definitions are included.

2. **CommonJS, ESM Support**: The library supports both CommonJS and ESM usage.

```javascript
const { MapleStoryApi } = require('maplestory-openapi/kms'); // CommonJS
```
```typescript
import { MapleStoryApi } from 'maplestory-openapi/kms'; // ESM
```

3. **TS2307 Cannot find module**: it may be due to the `moduleResolution` option being set to `node`. In such cases, update it to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler` as shown below

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext"
  }
}
```

### Sample Code

Below is an example that retrieves the identifier of a specific character from the KMS server based on the nickname, and then fetches that character’s basic information.

```javascript
const { MapleStoryApi } = require('maplestory-openapi/kms');
const { MapleStoryApiError } = require('maplestory-openapi');

const apiKey = '{Your API Key}';
const api = new MapleStoryApi(apiKey);

try {
  // run your code

  const character = await api.getCharacter('{Your Character Name}');
  const characterBasic = await api.getCharacterBasic(character.ocid);

  console.log(characterBasic);
} catch (e) {
  // exception handling

  if (e instanceof MapleStoryApiError) {
    // handle MapleStoryApiError
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```

### Features
This library supports all apis published in the MapleStory OpenAPI official docs.

Some features are supported only in specific regions. Please refer to the official documentation for each region for details.

- KMS: [https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestory](https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestory)
- TMS: [https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestorytw](https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestorytw)
- MSEA: [https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestorysea](https://openapi.nexon.com/game/maplestorysea)

### Exception Handling

Handle `MapleStoryApiError` to safely make calls, ensuring that specific Status defined in the [MapleStory OpenAPI Guide](https://openapi.nexon.com/guide/request-api) are not encountered.

While `MapleStoryApi` is designed to prevent the occurrence of certain Status, exceptions may arise due to developer mistakes.

Therefore, it's recommended to use `MapleStoryApiError` for exception handling based on the `MapleStoryApiErrorCode` list described in the table below.

| ErrorCode    | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| OPENAPI00001 | Internal server error                            |
| OPENAPI00002 | Access denied                                    |
| OPENAPI00003 | Invalid identifier                               |
| OPENAPI00004 | Request format error (incorrect parameter input) |
| OPENAPI00005 | Invalid api key                                  |
| OPENAPI00006 | Invalid api path                                 |
| OPENAPI00007 | Request allowance (Rate Limit) exceeded          |
| OPENAPI00009 | Not prepared data                                |
